Whoa

(Whoa)

(And so we pray)

I pray that I don't give up
Pray that I do my best
Pray that I can lift up
Pray my brother is blessed
Praying for enough, pray Virgilio wins
Pray I judge nobody and forgive me my sins

I pray we make it
Pray, my friend, I pull through
Pray as I take it onto others, I do
Praying on your love, we pray with every breath
Though I'm in the valley of the shadow of death

(And so we pray) for someone to come and show me the way
(And so we pray) for some shelter and some records to play
(And so we pray) we'll be singing "Baraye"
Pray that we make it to the end of the day

(And so we pray) I know somewhere that heaven is waitin'
(And so we pray) I know somewhere there's something amazin'
(And so we pray) I know somewhere we'll feel no pain
Until we make it to the end of the day

Hay que aceptarlo
Si nos perdimos fue tal vez para encontrarnos
Y nos caemos pa' aprender a levantarnos
Para abrazarnos
Porque vivir es darse cuenta que todo pasa por algo

Y poco a poco
Vamos brindando por los corazones rotos
Y sonriendo no solo para las fotos
Todos nosotros, mirando el cielo desde el suelo
Somos la misma piel

(And so we pray) for someone to come and show me the way
(And so we pray) for some shelter and some records to play
(And so we pray) we'll be singin' "Baraye"
Pray that we make it to the end of the day

(And so we pray) I know somewhere that heaven is waitin'
(And so we pray) I know somewhere there's something amazin'
(And so we pray) I know somewhere we'll feel no pain
Until we make it to the end of the day

On my knees, I pray, as I sleep and wake
'Cause inside my head is a frightening place
Keep a smiling face only by disgrace
'Cause love's more than I can take, hey

(And so we pray) and so we pray
(And so we pray) and so we pray
(And so we pray) we'll be singin' "baraye"
'Til nobody's in need and everybody can sing

La-la-la-la-la-la-la (la-la)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la (la-la-la-la)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la (sing it to me)
La-la-la-la-la we pray, we pray
La-la-la-la-la-la-la (I know somewhere that heaven is waitin') (is waitin')
La-la-la-la-la-la-la (I know somewhere there's something amazin') (something amazin')
La-la-la-la-la-la-la (until we feel no pain)
La-la-la-la-la we pray, we pray, we pray

La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la we pray, we pray, we pray
