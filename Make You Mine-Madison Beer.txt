I-I-I wanna feel, feel, feel
Wanna taste, taste, taste
Wanna get you goin'
I-I-I wanna lay, lay, lay
Wanna string, string, string
Wanna make you mine

Live inside my mind
You can see the shrine
Got you on my walls
Believe it (believe it)
Baby, don't be scared
Want you everywhere
Catch you if you fall
I mean it (I mean it)

Closer I get
Can you resist?
It's relentless
It's why

I wanna feel the rush
I wanna taste the crush
I wanna get you goin'
I wanna lay you down
I wanna string you up
I wanna make you mine

I wanna feel the rush
I wanna taste the crush
I wanna feel
I wanna lay you down
I wanna string you up
I wanna make you mine

I-I-I wanna feel, feel, feel
Wanna taste, taste, taste
Wanna get you goin'
I-I-I wanna lay, lay, lay
Wanna string, string, string
Wanna make you mine

Make you mine
(Can't you feel the rush?)
(Can't you feel the rush?)
(Can't you feel the rush?)
Make you mine

See it in my eyes
How they never lie
Just a little bite
Are you dreamin'? (Are you dreamin'?)
Now I got you up
Would you look at us?
Fantasy the life
And I'm screamin', screamin'

Closer I get
Can you resist?
It's relentless
It's why

I wanna feel the rush
I wanna taste the crush
I wanna get you goin'
I wanna lay you down
I wanna string you up
I wanna make you mine

I wanna feel the rush
I wanna taste the crush
I wanna feel
I wanna lay you down
I wanna string you up
I wanna make you mine

I-I-I wanna feel, feel, feel
Wanna taste, taste, taste
Wanna get you goin'
I-I-I wanna lay, lay, lay
Wanna string, string, string
Wanna make you mine

I-I-I wanna feel, feel, feel
Wanna taste, taste, taste
Wanna get you goin'
I-I-I-I-I-I wanna string, string, string
Wanna make you mine

Make you mine
(Can't you feel the rush?)
(Can't you feel the rush?)
(Can't you feel the rush?)
Make you mine
