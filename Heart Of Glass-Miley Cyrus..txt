Once had love and it was a gas
It soon turned out, I had a heart of glass
Seemed like the real thing, only to find
Much o' mistrust, love's gone behind

Once had love and it was divine
I soon found out I was losing my mind
It seemed like the real thing, but I was so blind
Much o' mistrust, love's gone behind

In between, what I find is pleasing and I'm feeling fine
Love is so confusing, there's no peace of mind
If I fear I'm losing you, it's just no good
You teasing like you do

Once had love and it was a gas
Soon turned out, I had a heart of glass
Seemed like the real thing, only to find
Much o' mistrust, love's gone behind

Lost inside, adorable illusion, and I cannot hide
I'm the one you're using
Please don't push me aside
We could have made it cruising, yeah

Na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na, yeah
Riding high on love's true bluish light

Woah, oh-oh
Woah, oh-oh
Woah, oh-oh
Woah, oh-oh

Once had love and it was a gas
It soon turned out to be a pain in the ass
Seemed like the real thing, only to find
Much o' mistrust, love's gone behind-ind

Ooh, oh-oh
Ooh, oh-oh
Ooh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh
