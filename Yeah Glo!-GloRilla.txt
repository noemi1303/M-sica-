GloRilla (B100)
(Go Grizz) on the gang, gang
On the gang, gang, woo

Yeah, run up on big Glo, you won't, I bet your - be on the floor
Big carbon hit like Mayweather, Tula come through and bow a -
Got millions out that rap -, they hate a -, but they stole the flow
Got backend after backend comin', -, I stole the show

Don't run up on that -, she a headcase, all she do is shoot
I signed my deal up on a PJ and hopped out a parachute
I'm geeked, don't ask me 'bout no more features, I might just stare at you
I'm geeked, don't ask me 'bout no more features, I might embarrass you

(Yeah, Glo) stomp a lil' - with some shell toes
(Yeah, Glo) slappin' rap - and makin' bail, -
(Yeah, Glo) two-tone Cartier match the nails, -
(Yeah, Glo) no competition, these - stale, -

(Yeah, Glo) Cuban on Cuban, my - in layers, -
(Yeah, Glo) say they get money, but I can't tell, -
(Yeah, Glo) keep runnin' circles around these snail -
(Yeah, Glo) and my - bumpin' up in the jail, -, on the gang

"Big Glo, where you been at?" Mane, everywhere, I'm workin' hard
Maybach and G-Wagon trucks, got M&M's in my garage
Quick to crank up on a -, you - better not get me started
Locked in with the gangstas and players, my folks gon' keep it solid

Everything I got on new, it look like I got renovated (ayy)
I'm cocky, -, when I was just humble they didn't appreciate it
Young wealthy and ratchet, I'm the hood - motivation (stamped it)
On top of the world now, they tried to underestimate me (haha)

(Get 'em, Glo) them - fraudulent, you know you the truth
(Get 'em, Glo) stop overthinkin', these - can't - with you (period)
(Get 'em, Glo) standin' on bidness in these Chanel shoes
Before I let a - play with me, I'll go eat some jail food, on gang

(Yeah, Glo) stomp a lil' - with some shell toes
(Yeah, Glo) slappin' rap - and makin' bail, -
(Yeah, Glo) two-tone Cartier match the nails, -
(Yeah, Glo) no competition, these - stale, -

(Yeah, Glo) Cuban on Cuban, my - in layers, -
