Got my heart made up on you

You said what you said
When words are knives, it's hard not to forget (to forget)
But something in my head wouldn't reset
Can't give up on us yet
No, whoa (no whoa)

Your love was so real
It pulled me in just like a magnetic field
I let you go, but something's taking the wheel
Yeah, it's taking the wheel
Oh, whoa

My mind says no
You're no good for me
You're no good, but heart's made up on you
My body can't take what you give to me
What you give got my heart made up on you

(Got my heart made up on you)

I should be making a break
Up all night thinking of planning my escape
But this insomnia ain't going away
And now I'm back at your place
Oh, no

My mind says no
You're no good for me
You're no good, but my heart's made up on you
My body can't take what you give to me
What you give got my heart made up on you

(Got my heart made up on you)

Look what you did, what you did
What you're doing to me
You got me searching for the words like a silent movie
Love can't breathe, love can't see
So out of control
But baby, honestly, my hands are up I'm letting go (go, go, go-)

Got my heart made up on you

My mind says no
You're not good for me
You're not good, but my heart's made up on you
My body can't take what you give to me
What you give got my heart made up on you

My heart
Says no
Got my heart made up on you
(Up on you)
(Up on you)
Yeah
