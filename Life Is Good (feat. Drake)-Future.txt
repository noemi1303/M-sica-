Workin' on a weekend like usual
Way off in the deep end like usual
N- swear they passed us, they doin' too much
Haven't done my taxes, I'm too turnt up
Virgil got a Patek on my wrist going nuts
N- caught me slipping once, okay, so what?
Someone hit your block up, I'd tell you if it was us
Manor house in Rosewood, this sh- too plush

Say my days are numbered, but I keep wakin' up
Know you see my texts, baby, please say somethin'
Wine by the glass, your man a cheapskate, huh?
N- gotta move off my release day, huh?

This is fame, not clout
I don't even know what that's about, watch your mouth
Baby got a ego twice the size of the crib
I can never tell her sh-, it is what it is
Said what I had to and did what I did
Never turn my back on FBG, God forbid
Virgil got the Patek on my wrist doing frontflips
Giving you my number, but don't hit me on no dumb sh-
