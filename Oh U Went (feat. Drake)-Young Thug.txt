6 God, he a visionary
I'm the definition like the dictionary
Baby turn around, forget the missionary
If they pull up on me with some bad intentions, you gon read about it in obituary
I got more soldiers than a military
Got more stones than a cemetery
Mo strings, and y’all are February [?]
It’s getting hard to put a price on a show, can’t even pick an amount now
If a nigga really try to jam me, get jammed first like the countdown
I thank God for that flight straight from the 9 side going southbound
They say that life’s about balance baby, and the balance is in my account now
Okay, she gotta perc and a birk
I got her twerking in turks
She’ll probably let both of us hit
The way that she smirking at dirk
She getting cake off the pictures she take
I said girl if it work then it work
Fuck a wedding dress, I'm tryna murk it then skrrrrt
