Did you have the time of your life?
Let's have the afterparty at my place
Ayy, do you have some spare change?
On me, I've got hundreds I'll throw in your face

Yeah, order more bottles, order more models
Order more hours, shots on an island
Hotter than the summer, the winter couldn't chill me
Young, free, and wildin', order more kidneys

Dope, I'm so dope
All these hunnies pilin' on the floor
And we stuntin', know you see the glow
Throw these hundreds, thought I'd let you know

Cirque du Soleil, goin' on and on
I got this money, tell me what you want
For this money, can you drop it low?

Yeah, order more bottles, order more models
Order more hours, shots on an island
Hotter than the summer, the winter couldn't chill me
Young, free, and wildin', order more kidneys

So order more kidneys (so order more kidneys)

Freaks come out at night
We bring our fantasy to life
Point me to the ice
And I don't need your drink, high off life
Uh, someone kill the lights
I brought the party favors, just get piped
All my bitches right
But I want you and you tonight
