(Metro, metro, metro, metro)
Drankin' dope turned me to a superhero, yeah, yeah
Hit that pill, turned me to a superhero, yeah, yeah
Boominati turned me to a superhero, yeah, yeah (Metro)
(If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you)

I'm on that dope again, I'm in that flow again
Switch up the flow again, yeah, yeah
Flyer than a parachute, gripping that pole again
I'm on that oil again, yeah, yeah

Candy in the cup, gotta get paid
King in the streets, young nigga made
Sprayin' up the crowd, take it to the grave
Ain't havin' problems, I'm sippin' the bar
Shoutout to Dallas, my bitch is a star
Nigga get rich, ready take you to war
Piss on your casket, shoot at your broad

Do you something nasty, roll you in a 'gar
Bitch get graphic, fuck me in a car
I get you a brand new Rollie tomorrow
I put that brand new Rollie on your arm
Ain't movin' slow but I'm still on oil
Tennis bracelets and they came with the frost
Cuban links all the way up to your jaw
Step up the swag when I step on a broad

Two dollar half, ooh, that's the cheapest one
Stackin' these hundreds up, like coupons
Told you from the beginning, upper echelon
And I get to stackin' up, I'm untouchable
I get to represent, money multiple
I'm at the top of the charts, unapproachable
Bread by the loaf, turbo the motor
Tic-tac-toe, killing all the vultures

Selling elbows, bitch do yoga
I deserve awards, serving these boulders
A hundred grand large when I shop, that's the total
Fill up the garage, bitch, I'm a mogul
Ain't no facadin', ain't no fugazi
I drop it off, I get paid
Drop top Royce, I'm going crazy
I push off, smoking on haze
Not tryna floss, Cartier shades

Candy in the cup, gotta get paid
King in the streets, young nigga made
Sprayin' up the crowd, take it to the grave
Ain't havin' problems, I'm sippin' the bar
Shoutout to Dallas, my bitch is a star
Nigga get rich, ready take you to war
Piss on your casket, shoot at your broad

Do you something nasty, roll you in a 'gar
Bitch get graphic, fuck me in a car
I get you a brand new Rollie tomorrow
I put that brand new Rollie on your arm
Ain't movin' slow but I'm still on oil
Tennis bracelets and they came with the frost
Cuban links all the way up to your jaw
Step up the swag when I step on a broad

Dark Knight feeling, die or be a hero
Or live long enough to see yourself become a villain

Soon as you up, these niggas wanna bring you down
The weight of the world sit on my shoulders, hold the crown
I ain't got a cape so I can't save you now
Niggas wanna hate, rather see you drown (yeah)
And the world keep spinnin' (yeah)
Like I'm the only one in it (am I the only one?) Why?
They don't wanna see you winnin' (no, no, no, no)
So who's really the villain? (Yeah)
(Whooo, who's the villain? Who's the villain?)
(Live long enough to see yourself become a villain)
