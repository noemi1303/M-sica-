At this point, it's like I'm beggin'
Shit, if I gotta fight for love, then, shit
It's like I don't even, I don't even want it
(Known to let that MAC fly just like my nigga Doe, bah)
Help me
Baby, can you help me?
Baby, can you help me?
Baby, can you help me?

I'm tryna get my life together, leave these hoes alone
Pray to God I can leave the streets, this thuggin' shit gettin' more than old
Baby, please don't leave, but every day, her heart get more than cold
I'm tired of pipin' these bitches up, on top of shit like provolone

I'm tryna run my digits up, at the same time, watch what them crackers on
Bitch, I call, you ain't pickin' up, what the fuck these hoes be on?
I just went bought 14 acres, used to stay up in the mobile homes
Need a bad bitch with low body count to put my focus on

Nigga, he tried to end my career, truth be told, I don't fuck with holmes
So many bad bitches up in here, which one of them I'm takin' home?
Bitch, I'm ballin' on all these niggas, same court that the Lakers on
I'm more wealthy than all these niggas, baby girl, my paper long

Do you love me? Do you trust me?
Say you got my back, but it's that paper got you wanna fuck me
Can I keep it real for a second, baby? Would you judge me?
I can't lie, I ain't been the same ever since them niggas stuck me
That shit corrupt me
I'ma get that get-back even if I get life, trust me
'Til the end, nigga, I'm kicked back in the cut poppin' up on bubbly
Look your nigga in the eyes and tell him I say he can't fuck with me
If I take her to my house, stick it in, that lil' bitch stuck with me

Lil' bitch playin' mind games, tryna trick my mindframe
You block me, bitch, I won't call you back, I promise it's just a mind thing
In that Hellcat, hit the gas, you hear that whine, ain't it?
Upped a hundred pack, I'm talkin' way before I got signed, baby

Why I ain't got no hit song yet? 'Cause I guess it ain't my time yet
Promise to stay down with this shit until my eyes go blind, yeah
Told you, bitch, I'm done with all that cheatin', stop that cryin', yeah
Same shit I said the last time, but I ain't done yet

Fuckin' another bitch, I told you I'm out here gettin' mon', yeah
Told you I'm on the way, but I'm still fuckin', bitch, I ain't cum yet
Bought you another whip, but you just speak on what I ain't done yet
Yeah, I cheated on you, but you were the realest bitch, I love that

Do you love me? Do you trust me?
Say you got my back, but it's that paper got you wanna fuck me
Can I keep it real for a second, baby? Would you judge me?
I can't lie, I ain't been the same ever since them niggas stuck me
That shit corrupt me
I'ma get that get-back even if I get life, trust me
'Til the end, nigga, I'm kicked back in the cut poppin' up on bubbly
Look your nigga in the eyes and tell him I say he can't fuck with me
If I take her to my house, stick it in, that lil' bitch stuck with me
