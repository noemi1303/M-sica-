Move to the city with me
I don't wanna be alone
(Don't wanna be alone)
You're too pretty for me
Baby, I know (it's true), yeah

You look better when you first wake up
Than anybody else I've fucked
Baby, I got good luck with you
I didn't know we'd get so far
And it's only the start
Baby, you got me worried (ayy)

Your love is scaring me
No one has ever cared for me
As much as you do
Ooh, yeah, I need you here, oh
Your love is scaring me
No one has ever cared for me
As much as you do
Ooh, yeah, I need you here

Drivin' through the city with me
Just watchin' you glow

I'm in the passenger seat, you're in control
(It's on you now) Mhm

You look better every day, I swear
Really, it's a little unfair
Baby, I'm star-struck by you
Didn't know we'd get so far
And it's only the start
Baby, you got me worried (ayy)

Your love is scaring me
No one has ever cared for me
As much as you do
Ooh, yeah, I need you here, oh
Your love is scaring me
No one has ever cared for me
As much as you do
Ooh, yeah, I need you here

If we fall apart, maybe it wasn't meant to be

If we fall apart, it was our favourite dream

Ooh, ooh, ahh-aaah

Your love is therapy
No drug can give me clarity
As much as you do (as you do, baby)
Ooh, yeah, I need you here (I need you here)
Your love is scaring me (no one)
No one has ever cared for me (ooh, baby)
As much as you do
Oooh (hey, yeah), yeah, I need you here (oh-oh, oh-oh)

(Ooh, I need you, babe)
Ooh, ooh, ahh
(Yeah, yeah, I need you, baby)
Yeah
(Ooh ooh, I need you)
