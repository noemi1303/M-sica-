Something's got a hold of me lately
No, I don't know myself anymore
Feels like the walls are all closing in
And the devil's knocking at my door, whoa

Out of my mind, how many times
Did I tell you I'm no good at being alone?
Yeah, it's taking a toll on me, trying my best to keep
From tearing the skin off my bones, don't you know

I lose control
When you're not next to me
I'm falling apart right in front of you, can't you see?
I lose control
When you're not next to me, mm-hmm
Yeah, you're breaking my heart, baby
You make a mess of me

Problematic
Problem is I want your body like a fiend, like a bad habit
Bad habit's hard to break when I'm with you
Yeah, I know, I could do it on my own, but I want
That real full moon black magic and it takes two

Problematic
Problem is when I'm with you, I'm an addict
And I need some relief, my skin in your teeth
Can't see the forest through the trees
Got me down on my knees, darling, please, oh

I lose control
When you're not next to me
I'm falling apart right in front of you, can't you see?
I lose control
When you're not next to me, mm-hmm
Yeah, you're breaking my heart, baby
You make a mess of me, yeah

I lose control
When you're not here with me, mm
I'm falling apart right in front of you, can't you see?
I lose control
When you're not here with me, mm-hmm
Yeah, you're breaking my heart, baby
You make a mess of me
