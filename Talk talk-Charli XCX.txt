(Talk to me)
Troye, baby
Hay una fiesta en mi casa, vengan
Será muy divertido

Are we getting too close?
You're leaving things in my head
I'll be honest, you scare me
My life's supposed to be a party (do you ever think about me?)

'Cause we talk that talk, and we talk all night
And the more I know you, the more I like you
Can you stick with me? Maybe just for life?
And say what's on your mind? My baby

Talk to me in French, talk to me in Spanish
Talk to me in your own made-up language
Doesn't matter if I understand it (my baby)
Talk right in my ear
Tell me your secrets and fears
Once you talk to me, I'll talk to you
And say, "Hey, can we go back to my place?"

'Kay, here's the plan
I wanna fly you out to Amsterdam
I got a good hotel to fuck you in, I wanna
Boy, come see me
We could pop our shit to Charli
And I need your arms around me

Talk to me in French, French, French, French
Talk-talk-talk-talk-talk to me in Spanish, Spanish, Spanish, Spanish
Talk-talk-talk-talk to me in French, French, French, French
Talk-talk-talk-talk-talk to me in Spanish, Spanish
Shall we go back to my place?

You're thinking 'bout me (thinking 'bout me)
No, don't pretend that you aren't (you aren't)
We're still obsessed like we just met (just met)
And when you fuck me, it's crazy (crazy)
You're thinking 'bout me

'Cause we talk that talk, and we talk all night
And the more I know you, the more I like you
Can you stick with me? Maybe just for life?
And say what's on your mind? My baby

Talk to me in French, talk to me in Spanish
Talk to me in your own made-up language
Doesn't matter if I understand it
Talk right in my ear
Tell me your secrets and fears
Once you talk to me, I'll talk to you
And say, "Hey, shall we go back to my place?"

Shall we go back to my–
Talk to me in French, French, French, French
Talk-talk-talk-talk-talk-talk to me in Spanish, Spanish, Spanish, Spanish
Talk-talk-talk-talk-talk to me in French, French, French, French
Talk-talk-talk-talk-talk-talk to me in Spanish, Spanish
Shall we go back to my place?

J'ai perdu mon téléphone mais tu sais quoi?
Ça valait la peine parce que c'était une soirée de fou
Yeah, last night was crazy
Let's do it again
Shall we go back to my place?
