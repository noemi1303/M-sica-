You care for me
When no one else is there for me
You provide air for me to breathe
I'll watch you, restlessly

My (ooh), mind (ooh)
I (ooh-ooh-ooh), wanna get it right

Take it easy
Take it easy

Take it easy

You care for me
When no one else is there for me
You provide air for me to breathe
I'll watch you, restlessly

My (ooh), mind (ooh)
I (ooh-ooh-ooh), wanna get it right

Hey, I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to fall out of love with you
Because I truly did love you
I still do, but not in the same way

Take it easy
Take it easy

Take it easy, now
Take it easy
