Gold teeth sittin' on the dash, she a rockstar
Make your favorite singer wanna rap, baby, la, la
"Lisa, can you teach me Japanese?" I said, "はい, はい"
That's my life, life, baby, I'm a rockstar

Been on a mission, boy, they call me catch-and-kill
I'm stealin' diamonds, make them chase me for the thrill
Been MIA, BKK so pretty (pretty)
Every city that I go is my city

Gold teeth sittin' on the dash, she a rockstar
Make your favorite singer wanna rap, baby, la, la
"Lisa, can you teach me Japanese?" I said, "はい, はい"
That's my life, life, baby, I'm a rockstar

I'm a rockstar, I'm a rockstar
It's not hype, hype, baby, make you rock-hard

Make a wish, babe, what you wanna do?
Dippin' out of big cities like a ponzu
It's a fast life, it's an attitude
Put it on the calendar and tell me when to come through
Yes, yes, I can spend it, yes, yes, no pretendin'
Tight dress, LV sent it, oh, shit, Lisa reppin'

Been on a mission, boy, they call me catch-and-kill
I'm stealin' diamonds, make them chase me for the thrill
Been MIA, BKK so pretty (pretty)
Every city that I go is my city

Ooh, don't it get you in a mood?
It's not hype, hype, baby, I'm a rockstar
