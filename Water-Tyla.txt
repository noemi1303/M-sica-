Make me sweat
Make me hotter
Make me lose my breath
Make me water
Make me sweat
Make me hotter
Make me lose my breath
Make me water

Normally
I can keep my cool, but tonight I'm wildin'
Imma be
In a dangerous mood, can you match my timing?
Mm, mm
Telling me
That you really 'bout it, why try hide it?
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Talk is cheap, so show me
That you understand how I like it

Can you blow my mind?
Set off my whole body
If I give you my time
Can you snatch my soul from me?
I don't wanna wait, come take it
Take me where I ain't been before
Can you blow my mind?
Set off my whole body
Whole body

Make me sweat
Make me hotter
Make me lose my breath
Make me water
Make me sweat
Make me hotter
Make me lose my breath
Make me water

Hopefully
You can last all night, don't get too excited
Ooh, oh, privacy
You ain't gotta go nowhere, you can stay inside it

Can you blow my mind?
Set off my whole body
If I give you my time
Can you snatch my soul from me?
I don't wanna wait, come take it
Take me where I ain't been before
Can you blow my mind?
Set off my whole body
Whole body
