I ain't never seen nuthin' that'll make me go
This crazy all night spendin' my dough
Had a million dollar vibe and a bottle to go
Them birthday cakes, they stole the show
So sexual, she was flexible
Professional, drinkin' X & O
Hold up wait a minute, do I see what I think I
Whoa
Did I think I seen shorty get Low
Ain't the same when it's up that close
Make it rain, I'm makin' it snow
Work the pole, I got the bank roll
I'm a say that I prefer them no clothes
I'm into that, I love women exposed
She threw it back at me, I gave her more
Cash ain't a problem, I know where it goes
She had them

Cadillacs Maybachs for the sexy grown
Patrone on the rocks that'll make you moan
One stack, come on

Two stacks, come on
Three stacks, come on, now that's three grand
What you think I'm playin' baby girl
I'm the man, I'll bend the rubber bands

That's what I told her, her legs on my shoulder

I knew it was ova, that Henny & Cola
Got me like a Soldier
She ready for Rover, I couldn't control her
So lucky o me, I was just like a clover
Shorty was hot like a toaster
Sorry but I had to fold her
Like a pornography poster

She showed her
