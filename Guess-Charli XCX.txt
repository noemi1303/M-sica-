
You wanna guess the color of my underwear
You wanna know what I got going on down there
Is it pretty in pink or all see-through?
Is it showing off my brand new lower back tattoo?

You wanna put 'em in your mouth, pull 'em all down south
You wanna turn this shit out, that's what I'm talking about
Pu-pu-put 'em in your mouth, pull 'em all down south
You wanna turn this shit out, that's what I'm talking about (yeah)

Try it, bite it, lick it, spit it
Pull it to the side and get all up in it
Wear 'em, post 'em, might remix it
Send them to The Dare, yeah, I think he's with it

Try it, bite it, lick it, spit it
Pull it to the side and get all up in it
Wear 'em, post 'em, might remix it
Eat it up for lunch, yeah its so delicious

Don't have to guess, the color of your underwear
Already know what you got, going on down there
Its the lacy-black pair with little bows
The ones I picked out for you in Tokyo
I saw them when you sat down, they were peeking out
Im gonna tell you right now, they're all im thinking about

I wanna try it, bite it, lick it, spit it, pull to the side, and
Get up all in it, kiss it, bite it, can I fit it
Charli likes boys, but she knows I'd hit it

(Knows I'd hit it)
(Charli call me if you're with it)

(Yeah)

You wanna guess what Me and Billie have been texting about?
(Stop being disrespectful)
You are tryna' guess the password to my Google Drive
You wanna guess the address of the party we're at?

You wanna guess if we are serious about this song sc
