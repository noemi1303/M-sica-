I been known to miss a red flag
I been known to put my lover on a pedestal
In the end, those things just don't last
And it's time I take my rose-coloured glasses off

I already know your type, tellin' me the things I like (ah-ah)
Tryin' make me yours for life, takin' me for a ride (ah-ah)
I already know your type, think you can play your cards right (ah-ah)
Don't you know I could do this dance all night?

Ooh, what you doin'?
Don't know who you think that you're confusin'
I be like, ooh, it's amusin'
You think I'm gonna fall for an illusion

Dance all night, dance all night
Dance all night, dance all night
I be like, ooh
Dance all night, dance all night
Dance all night, dance, dance

Was a time when that shit might have worked
Was a time when I just threw a match and let it burn
Now I'm grown, I know what I deserve
I still like dancin' with the lessons I already learned

I already know your type, tellin' me the things I like (ah-ah)
Tryin' make me yours for life, takin' me for a ride (ah-ah)

Ooh, what you doin'?
Don't know who you think that you're confusin'
I be like, ooh, it's amusin'
You think I'm gonna fall for an illusion

Dance all night, dance all night
Dance all night, dance all night
I be like, ooh
Dance all night, dance all night
Dance all night, dance, dance

Illusion, I really like the way you're movin'
Yeah, I just wanna dance with the illusion
Yeah, I just wanna dance with
Yeah, I just wanna dance with

(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Ooh, what you doin'?
Don't know who you think that you're confusin'
