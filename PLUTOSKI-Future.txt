
Woah
Yeah, yeah
I don't even know what she is
I just took care of the bill
We not no regular niggas
These not the regular pointers
Stunt this and I'm just gon' show it
Thousand one grams on a chain
I'm gettin' my currency changed
Goin' out the country, street nigga, we gangsters
Shit you can get bein' famous
Can't hang with a nigga false claimin'
They just be tryna talk like us, yeah
Bitch don't know what clarity is
I've been runnin' shit for more than a few years, yeah (Plutoski)

[Verse 1]
Chop off the doors again (Ski)
Chop all the doors off the hinges (Plutoski)
Whip up the bowl again (Ski)
Trappin' out loads (Plutoski)
Sippin' on dope again (Ski)
I'm back in that mode (Plutoski)
Told all the dogs, "Work the other one" (Ski)
We got another one (Plutoski)
Filipino or Korean
I don't even know even know what she is
I just been taggin' 'em in
Ridin' with Satan again (Plutoski)
I throw the magazine in
Streets turn a boy to a man
We goin' dark, it's nasty
Use the lil' blogs to gas me
