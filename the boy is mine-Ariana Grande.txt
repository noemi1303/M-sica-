How can it be you and me?
Might be meant to be, can't unsee it
But I don't wanna cause no scene
I'm usually so unproblematic
So independent
Tell me why
'Cause the boy is mi-ine

Something about him is made for somebody like me
Baby, come over, come over (oh, my)
And God knows I'm trying, but there's just no use in denying

The boy is mine
I can't wait to try him
Let-let's get intertwined
The stars, they aligned
The boy is mine
Watch me take my timе
I can't believe my mind
The boy is divi-vi-vi-vi-vi-vinе
Boy is mine

Please know this ain't what I planned for
Probably wouldn't bet a dime or my life on
There's gotta be a reason why
My girls, they always come through in the sticky situation
Say, "It's fine" ("It's fine")
Happens all the ti-ime

Something about him is made for somebody like me
Baby, come over, come over (oh, my)
And God knows I'm trying, but there's just no use in denying

The boy is mine
I can't wait to try him
Let-let's get intertwined
The stars, they aligned
The boy is mine
Watch me take my time
I can't believe my mind
The boy is divi-vi-vi-vi-vi-vinе
Boy is-

And I know it's simply meant to be
And I, I take full accountability for all these tears
Promise you I'm not usually
Like this, shit! It's like news to me, to me
But I can't ignore my heart, boy!

The boy is mine
I can't wait to try him (ooh-ooh)
Let-let's get intertwined
The stars, they aligned
The boy is mine
Watch me take my time
I can't believe my mind
The boy is divi-vi-vi-vi-vi-vinе
Boy is mine
