Tell me what you want, what you like, it's okay
I'm a little curious too
Tell me if it's wrong, if it's right, I don't care
I can keep a secret, can you?

Got my mind on your body and your body on my mind
Got a taste for the cherry, I just need to take a bite
Don't tell your mother
Kiss one another
Die for each other
We're cool for the summer

Take me down into your paradise
Don't be scared, 'cause I'm your body type
Just something that we wanna try
'Cause you and I, we're cool for the summer

Tell me if I won, if I did, what's my prize?
I just wanna play with you too
Even if they judge, fuck it, I'll do the time
I just wanna have some fun with you

Got my mind on your body and your body on my mind

Take me down into your paradise
Don't be scared, 'cause I'm your body type

We're cool for the summer
We're cool for the summer

Shh, don't tell your mother

Got my mind on your body and your body on my mind
Got a taste for the cherry, I just need to take a bite
(Take me down)
