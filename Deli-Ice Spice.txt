She a baddie, she showin' her panty (she showin' her panty)
She shake it like jelly (she shake it like jelly, damn, damn)
Hunnit bands in Chanel-y (hundred bands in Chanel-y)
But I'm still shakin' ass in a deli (but I'm still shakin' ass, grrah)
With my bitch gettin' deady (with my bitch gettin' detty)
He like it a wetty (he like it more wetty)
Hе want the wap, but I just want the fetty (grrah)
And I'm baggin' his partner I'm petty (grrah)
Call me that B while he eatin' my honey (eatin' my honey, damn)
You know niggas love bitches with money (bitches with money)

Takin' ha spot
If you ain't cookin' then get off da pot
My name ice but I always stay hot
Passenger princess, he pass me his knock
Baddest lil' bitch from my block
Me and baddies be gettin' along
So they always be singin' my song
Steppin' outside, I'ma put that shit on (like)
Three hundred and then I perform (damn)
You know I'ma get to the bag
All da hatin' bitches to the back
Too much to lose so I cannot react
Damn, bitches be goin' out sad

They all like: Damn, ice ya flow be the hardest
I'm not a regular artist
Grrah, grrah
Go ku and I'm just gettin' started
Baddies on baddies, they know how to move
'Ooters on 'ooters, they know how to 'oot
Bussin' that pack, goin' straight to the Moon
Off the juice, actin' loose
