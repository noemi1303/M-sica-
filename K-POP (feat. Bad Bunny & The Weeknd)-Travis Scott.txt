(Gonna pop, baby)
(Vemo')

Swish, bih
Move that shit out here
You full off one sip
Fallin' off but I got grip (grip)
All around the trap, it hit (hit, hit, ayy)
All around the map, you trip (skrrt)
Take it like nine out of ten (yeah)
Think they gon' find that again
Think I gotta bond out again

Behind the tint, I sin, I vent
Can't forget about that place we went
Right after you put that in my head
Do you still pop 'em? Do you dance?
Do you still drop some'? Know you can
I got a lot, but I'm still chancin'

Yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah

Hace tiempo no te veo, eh
Es que ahora en Miami jangueo, eh, eh
Ya no tengo la Rodeo
Ahora en la G-Wagon, spoteo, ey

Y te lo meto al frente de la playa
Como aquello' tiempo' de camino a Maya
Tú ni fumaba' y, chingando, te arrebaté
Dale, no pierdas tiempo, no lo piense', trépate

Tú bien loca, loca
Yo bien loco, loco
Si ahora tu mai nos pilla
Me pide una foto

La nota me explota
El ticke' lo exploto
Vamo' pa' Cayo Musha
Ya le texteé al piloto, eh-eh

I know 'bout this one time
You felt like that winner, winner
That night was just so fire
I need you back sooner, sooner
You come back on this side
When shit get back cooler, cooler
We run it back one time
I'm grabbin' you uno

Ooh (uno)
Ooh-ooh (mm-mm, mm-mm)
Ooh (mm-mm, mm-mm)
Ooh-yeah (mm-mm)

Mix the drugs with the pain
Let the waves lead the way
You in Cannes and Saint-Tropez
Callin' out my name

You know I'm wrong in my face, uh
You know I'm high off that K-pop
Rubbin' up on your body
All your clothes, you gon' take off

South of France, we gon' party
This ain't some lil' yachty
We gon' fuck till we seasick
You my bad lil' mami, mami

You love me
You could tell me you love me
Even if you don't mean it
Sex'll make you believe it
I love it when she up on me
Love when she'll call me papi
Even though she Korean
Get her wet like tsunami, 'nami, ooh, yeah

I know 'bout this one time
You felt like that winner, winner
That night was just so fire
I need you back sooner, sooner
You come back on this side
When shit get back cooler, cooler
We run it back one time
I'm grabbin' you uno

Yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah (uno)
