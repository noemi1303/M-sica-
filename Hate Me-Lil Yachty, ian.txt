Shouldn't be drinkin' on lean, I'm already half dead
Give a fuck, I'm a gangster, I'm thuggin' (I'm thuggin', brrt, frrt-frrt)
Yeah (grow up, nigga), huh, yeah, huh, come on (Us)
Huh-huh, huh, yeah, yeah, yeah (brrt)
Come on, huh, huh
Wedding Cake in my blunt with no bride yet
If I face me another, I'll die here
I'm just prayin' I make it 'til Friday
Either way, I'ma die with my pride
Fell in love with the Cullinan parked out front
Bitch, wait 'til you see the garage
I done made me a promise, I'll fight back once
This time, I'ma leave it to God
On God, I ain't play 'bout nothin' once
When it's game time, jump in clutch
First thing in the mornin', blunt
First thing in the mornin'
I jump off the porch and head straight to the Porsche
Get to drivin' like somebody chasin'
Rock it 'cause I can afford it, my pockets enormous
Every time that I walk, I'm chafin'
You don't know how to ball, you lazy
You ignorin' my calls, shit crazy
One time for the hoes I'm savin'
One time for the hoes that hate me
Two times for the hoes that hate me
Three times for the hoes that hate me
Three-five in the blunt, I'm spacin'
Four doors on the Rolls, shit spacious
I don't know if it's-, uh
I don't know if it's smart I stay here
I don't know if I want that Maybach
I don't know if I'll find my way back
I ain't never gon' buy my way in
I ain't never gon' bow to no man
I don't care who the fuck you came with
I don't care what the fuck your name is (what? huh)
My Chrome unfindable
Like I did me a hit and I threw it away
Pop out that bitch and hit him in his fa-
Uh-huh
We open up doors in the summer
I took the roof off of the Hummer
I snuck in that bitch with a Llama
I'm sneakin' outside like Osama
Know I'm richer than your favorite rapper
If I'm not, then God, kill my mama
Biggest house on the street
The first Blacks here like Obama
Okay, let's see that thunder
On the plane, we took drugs under
And my bitch ass dumb like Yolanda
I'ma put the junk up from La Fonda
Fah-fah-fah-fah, yeah, fuck 'em
I be twistin' my fingers, I bang
And Concrete the gang
Same nigga, just rich, I ain't change
Same nigga, I'm totin' that flame
Huh, I'm the same old kid, but I gotta grow up now, I'm a grown-up now
I've been havin' some long-ass nights
One more long-ass flight 'fore I'm right there next to you
Huh, damn, driver, move up, my legs need room
Huh, huh, damn, I really could cop this backseat, huh (brrt)
I know all of my ex-hoes miss me
I was drifting, poured a whole sixteen
I'm gon' clutch it, I don't do no wrestling
And my mouth diamonds lookin' like a cuff link
Put my bitch in no DG, free BG
We on TV, I'm makin' a mo-
We on TV, I'm makin' a movie
Durag on my head, it's The Boonies
Fuck whoopin' his ass, he gon' sue me
I'll fuck it up fast, then re-up
Sip drink like I don't wanna be up
When we catch you, don't call for Jesus
