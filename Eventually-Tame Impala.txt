If only there could be another way to do this
'Cause it feels like murder to put your heart through this
I know I always said that I could never hurt you
Well, this is the very, very last time I'm ever going to

But I know that I'll be happier
And I know you will too
Said, I know that I'll be happier
And I know you will too

Eventually, ah-ah, ah, ah-ah
Eventually, ah-ah, ah, ah-ah

Wish I could turn you back into a stranger
'Cause if I was never in your life
You wouldn't have to change it

But I know that I'll be happier
And I know you will too
Said, I know that I'll be happier
And I know you will too

Eventually, ah-ah, ah, ah-ah
Eventually, ah-ah, ah, ah-ah

And I know just what I've got to do
And it's got to be soon
'Cause I know that I'll be happier
And I know you will too

Eventually, ah-ah, ah, ah-ah
Eventually, ah-ah, ah, ah-ah
Eventually, ah-ah, ah, ah-ah
Eventually, ah-ah, ah, ah-ah
Eventually, ah-ah, ah, ah-ah
Eventually, ah-ah, ah, ah-ah

Eventually
