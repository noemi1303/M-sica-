Yeah, this right here (tell me why)
Goes out to everyone that has lost someone
That they truly loved (c'mon, check it out)

It seems like yesterday we used to rock the show
I laced the track, you locked the flow
So far from hangin' on the block for dough
Notorious, they got to know that
Life ain't always what it seems to be
Words can't express what you mean to me
Even though you're gone, we still a team
Through your family, I'll fulfil your dream (that's right)

In the future, can't wait to see
If you open up the gates for me
Reminisce some time, the night they took my friend
Try to black it out, but it plays again
When it's real, feelings hard to conceal
Can't imagine all the pain I feel
Give anythin' to hear half your breath (half your breath)
I know you still livin' your life after death

Every step I take
Every move I make
Every single day, every time I pray
I'll be missin' you
Thinkin' of the day
When you went away
What a life to take, what a bond to break
I'll be missin' you (I miss you, B.I.G.)

It's kinda hard with you not around (yeah)
Know you in Heaven, smilin' down
Watchin' us while we pray for you
Every day, we pray for you
'Til the day we meet again
In my heart is where I'll keep you, friend
Memories give me the strength I need to proceed
Strength I need to believe

My thoughts, B.I.G., I just can't define (can't define)
Wish I could turn back the hands of time
Us in the six, shop for new clothes and kicks
You and me takin' flicks
Makin' hits, stages they receive you on
Still can't believe you're gone (can't believe you're gone)
Give anything to hear half your breath (half your breath)
I know you still livin' your life after death

Every step I take
Every move I make (I miss you)
Every single day, every time I pray
I'll be missin' you (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Thinkin' of the day
When you went away
What a life to take, what a bond to break
I'll be missin' you (somebody tell me why)

One glad morning
When this life is over
I know I'll see your face

Every night I pray, every step I take
Every move I make, every single day
Every night I pray, every step I take
(Every day that passes is a day that I get closer)
Every move I make, every single day (to seeing you again)
Every night I pray, every step I take
(We miss you, B.I.G., and we won't stop 'cause we can't stop)
Every move I make, every single day (that's right)
Every night I pray, every step I take
Every move I make, every single day (we miss you, B.I.G.)

Every step I take
Every move I make
Every single day, every time I pray
I'll be missin' you (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Thinkin' of the day
When you went away
What a life to take, what a bond to break
I'll be missin' you

Every step I take (yeah, yeah)
Every move I make
Every single day, every time I pray
I'll be missin' you
Thinkin' of the day
When you went away (oh)
What a life to take, what a bond to break
I'll be missin' you

Every step I take (one glad morning)
Every move I make (when this life is over)
Every single day, every time I pray (I know)
I'll be missin' you (I'll see your face)
Thinkin' of the day (one glad morning)
When you went away (when this life is over)
