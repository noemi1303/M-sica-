Yeah (yeah, yeah) yeah (yeah, yeah)
Fool, you know how we do it (whoa-oh, oh)
West Side
Comin' from the West Side
Nothin' but the West Side (whoa-oh, oh)

Ain't nothin' goin' on but the bomb-ass rap song
Hittin' all night long
Just like me on the black and white ivory
Gettin' six on artillery, you don't want to see a G (whoa-oh, oh)
Break yo' ass like dishes
Buster-ass tricks, sleep with the fishes
Runnin' from Lennox, up at Venice
They wanna have me in stripes, like Dennis the Menace (whoa-oh, oh)

But that ain't poppin', ain't no stoppin'
Fo'-hoppin', ass droppin', Coupe DeVille
My troupe can kill, fool I got skills
So, back on up 'fore I check that chin
Down for whatever and I'm full off Henn'
You gets no love and I thought you knew it
Fool, you know how we do it

Comin' from the West Side
West Side, comin' from the West Side
(Whoa-oh, oh)

Chillin' with the homies, smellin' the bud
Double-parked and I'm talkin' to Dub
About who got a plan, who got a plot
Who got got, and who got shot (whoa-oh, oh)
'Cause everybody knows that he got the info
Crazy Toones hangin' out the window
Fool, I got them bomb-ass tapes
Da Lench Mob, Planet of the Apes (whoa-oh, oh)

I'm down with Eiht, and Watts Up
Kam and Solo, they got nuts
When Ice Cube write a sentence
I want "The Bomb," just like George Clinton
S-K-P is down to catch a body
Put on Knee Deep, we'll turn out your party
You gets no love and I thought you knew it
Fool, you know how we do it (whoa-oh, oh)

You know how we do it (whoa-oh, oh)

Jack be nimble, and Jack be quick
If you wanna jack me on a lick, 'cause
I'm that fool from South Central
You think you stuck yourself, with a number two pencil (whoa-oh, oh)
That's how I poke hot lead in yo' ass
With "Mo' Bounce to the Ounce" in the dash

Mash up, Van Ness, headed for the West
Everything is great, slow down for the dip (whoa-oh, oh)
On a 100 and 8th and keep mashin'
Don't drink and drive to keep the fo' from crashin'
Stashin' a Glock and I thought you knew it
You know how we do it (whoa-oh, oh)

You know how we do it (whoa-oh, oh)
West Side
It's hittin' on the West Side
It's comin' on the West Side
It's nothin' on the West Side (whoa-oh, oh)
