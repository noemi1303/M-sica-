I believe in honesty
A little bit of honesty is always in my recipe
And you've been a good sign for me
But what I want for me is to make sure I get it just right this time

We're next in line
You're gonna slide (slide)
Into my life, you're gonna occupy the space right
We're next in line (we're next in line)
Let's take our time (let's take our time)
Don't pull the trigger 'til the energy is just right

Gotta be just slow enough
Gotta breathe, not too fast
Gotta be just slow enough
Why don't we stay focused?

You're fire, I don't really wanna waste your time
Go too fast and we get too high
Your eyes really make me wanna change my mind
Go too fast and we get too high
