I ain't never rep a set baby
I ain't do no wrong
I could clean up good for you
Oh I know right from wrong
Cause I wanna make it (so badly)
I'm a Million Dollar Baby (don't at me)
Hell no
You rep my city for so damn long
But you still don't notice me
My sound next
VA next
I'm at they neck
I'm running up a check
She a bad lil mama she a diva
No matter what happens he cannot come between us again
I know we're better than friends (better than friends)
I took her to Queen's Gambit, showed around my friends
Tried to pick some energy up it don't better
I know you haven't moved on, if you tried
I don't believe it baby, I know you lied
All night long
What you mean I changed
Haven't stayed the same
I've been losing my mind
I said the city is mine
I ain't never rep a set baby
Ain't do no wrong
I could clean up, do it for you
Oh I know right from wrong
Cause I wanna make it (so badly)
I'm a Million Dollar Baby (don't at me)
I ain't never rep a set baby
Ain't do no wrong
I could clean up, good for you
Oh I know right from wrong
Cause I wanna make it (so badly)
I'm a Million Dollar Baby (don't at me)
Hell no
Hell no
Hell no
