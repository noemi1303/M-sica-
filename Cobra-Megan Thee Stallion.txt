Breaking down and I had the whole world watching
But the worst part is really who watched me?
Every night I cried, I almost died
And nobody close tried to stop me
Long as everybody getting paid, right?
Everything will be okay, right?
I'm winning, so nobody tripping
Bet if I ever fall off everybody go missing

(At night) I'm sittin' in a dark room thinking
Probably why I always end up drinking
(Yes), I'm very depressed
How can somebody so blessed wanna slit they wrist?
Shit, I'd probably bleed out some Pinot
When they find me, I'm in Valentino, ayy
He pouring me shots thinking it's lit
Hah, little did he know

This pussy depressed, hmm
I'm about to stress him, yeah
Pink nails 'round his neck, huh
But this ain't domestic, ayy
Think it's going down, hah
Now he stand corrected, ayy
This pussy depressed, hmm
I'm about to stress him, ah

Ayy, damn I got problems
Never thought a bitch like me would ever hit rock bottom
Man, I miss my parents
Way too anxious, always cancel my plans
Pulled up, caught him cheatin'
Gettin' his dick sucked in the same spot I'm sleeping
Lord, give me a break
I don't know how much more of this shit I can take (ayy)

How long you been worried 'bout me telling people that's not me?
Honestly it kinda feel like you plottin', watching
Why is you speaking on me at my lowest
When you acted like you ain't noticed?

I was tripping, going crazy
And they low-key hatin' so they ain't gonna say shit
Damn, I finally see it
I'm killing myself when bitches would die to be me

This pussy depressed, hmm
I'm about to stress him, yeah
Pink nails 'round his neck, huh
But this ain't domestic, ayy
Think it's going down, hah
Now he stand corrected, ayy
This pussy depressed, hmm
I'm about to stress him, ah

I ain't going, yeah
No emotion, ayy
Back outside, yeah
Back in motion, ayy
He keep calling, hmm
I ignore it, ayy
He say I'm crazy, hmm
Don't I know it, ah
