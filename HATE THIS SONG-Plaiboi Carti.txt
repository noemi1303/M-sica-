HATE THIS SONG
Last night I heard a song it brought back
all these awful feelings
I never listened long enough but now I get the meaning
I was your broken record soundtrack
to your starry ceiling
I tried to escape and started over is it worth repeating
You say you're alone and I'll still lie awake at night
I can't stop thinking 'bout the way you said

I hope you hear this song over and over again
I hope it burns a hole right through your fuc*** head
And while you're out there dancing to someone new
I hope you hear this song
and I hopе it kills you too
I hope you hate this song (Hate this song)
Likе I hate you (Like I hate you)

The ghost of humanity it haunts me
like a fading echo
You cut through the silence
like the sirens hear my bedroom window
I should be moving on but you don't wanna let me let go
I've heard this one a million times and I hope -

That when you hear this song over and over again
I hope it burns the whole blood through your fuc*** head
And while you're out there dancing to someone new
I hope you hear this song
I hope it kills you too
I hope you hate this song (Hate this song)
Like I hate you (Like I hate you)
When you hear my voice, I hope it makes you sick
Next time you sing along, you can choke on

Yeah
I hope it makes you sick, sick, sick, sick
I hope it makes you sick
(Hahaha, shit)

I hope you hear this song over and over again
I hope it burns a hole right through your fuc*** head
And while you're at it dance it to someone new
I hope you hear this song
I hope it kills you too
I hope you hate this song
I hope you hate this song
Like I hate you
Like I hate you

I hope you hate this song
I fuc*** hate this song
Like I hate you
Like I hate you
I hope you hate this song
