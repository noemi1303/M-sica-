See this in 3D, all lights out for me
All lights out for me, lightning strikes the beach
80 degrees, warm it up for me
Finally free, found the God in me
And I want you to see, I can walk on water
Thousand miles from shore, I can float on the water
Father, hold me close, don't let me drown
I know you won't

Yeah, walking on the bridge, I threw my sins over the deep end
Sipping 'til my stomach hurt, this month I done lost three friends
Early morning, brainstorming, normally I can't sleep in
Sometimes I just wanna restart it, but it all depends
If I'ma be the same young hungry - from West End
Wrote my hardest wrongs and the crazy part, I ain't have no pen
Maybach interior came with sheepskin
Still remember when I just had three bands

Now I'm the one everyone calling on 'cause I got deep pants
Bro' told me to wait to beat the game, it's all in defense
And never fazed by names that they might call me, but they gon' respect it
And I feel like you better off tryin' to call, I might not get the message
And she just tried to run off with my heart, but I blocked off the exit, yeah

Oh-oh, I know You won't, I know You won't, I know You won't
I know You won't, I know that You look over us
So we silently sleep
Bring down the rain, yeah, oh-oh

Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm, I was out for self
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm, I was up for sale
But I couldn't tell
God made it rain, the devil made it hell
Dropped out of school, but I'm that one at Yale
Made the best tracks and still went off the rail
Hat go down, down, down, this the new town, town, town
This the new ten, ten, ten, I'm going in, in, in

Here I go on a new trip, here I go acting too lit
Here I go acting too rich, here I go with a new chick
And I know what the truth is, still playing after two kids
It's a lot to digest when your life always moving
Architectural Digest, but I needed home improvement
60 million dollar home, never went home to it
Genius gone clueless, it's a whole lot to risk
Alcohol Anonymous, who's the busiest loser?

Heated by the rumors, read into it too much
Fiending for some true love, ask Kim, "What did you love?"
Hard to find what the truth is, but the truth was that the truth suck
Always seem to do stuff, but this time it was too much
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm, everybody so judgmental
Everybody so judgmental
Everybody hurts, but I don't judge rentals
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm, it was all so simple

I see you in 3D, the dawn is bright for me
No more dark for me, I know you're watching me
80 degrees, burning up the leaves
Finally, I'm free, finally, I'm free
As I go out to sea, I can walk on water
Won't you shine Your light? Demons stuck on my shoulder
Father, hold me close, don't let me drown
I know you won't
