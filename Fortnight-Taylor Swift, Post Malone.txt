I was supposed to be sent away
But they forgot to come and get me
I was a functioning alcoholic
'Til nobody noticed my new aesthetic
All of this to say, I hope you're okay
But you're the reason
And no one here's to blame
But what about your quiet treason?

And for a fortnight there, we were forever running
Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather
Now you're in my backyard turned into good neighbors
Your wife waters flowers, I want to kill her

All my mornings are Monday stuck in an endless February
I took the miracle move-on drug
The effects were temporary
And I love you, it's ruining my life
I love you, its ruining my life
I touched you for only a fortnight
I touched you, but I touched you

And for a fortnight there, we were forever running
Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather
Now you're in my backyard turned into good neighbors
Your wife waters flowers, I want to kill her

And for a fortnight there, we were together running
Run into you sometimes, comment on my sweater
Now you're at the mailbox turned into good neighbors
My husband is cheating, I want to kill him

I love you, it's ruining my life
I love you, it's ruining my life
I touched you for only a fortnight
I touched you, I touched you
I love you, it's ruining my life
I love you, it's ruining my life
I touched you for only a fortnight
I touched you, I touched you

Thought of calling ya, but you won't pick up
Another fortnight lost in America
Move to Florida, buy the car you want
But it won't start up 'til you touch, touch, touch me

I call you up, but you won't pick up
Another fortnight lost in America
Move to Florida, buy the car you want
But it won't start up 'til I touch, touch, touch you
